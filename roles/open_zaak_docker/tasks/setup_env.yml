# /var/lib/docker/volumes is by default only enter-able by the root user. However,
# nginx on the host system serves the files for private media uploads, which runs as
# the nginx user.
# Therefore, we change the group of /var/lib/docker/volumes to add the +x permission,
# and add nginx to that group.
