# /home/podman/.local/share/containers/storage/volumes is by default only enter-able by
# the podman user. However, nginx on the host system serves the files for private media
# uploads, which runs as the nginx user.
# Therefore, we change the group of /home/podman/.local/share/containers/storage/volumes
# to add the +x permission, and add nginx to the podman group.
